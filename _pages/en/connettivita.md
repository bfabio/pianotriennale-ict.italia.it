The PA must initiate processes for upgrading their connectivity in order to provide services related to both internal administrative procedures and public services to citizens and businesses. The strategy for the realisation of the Plan in terms of connectivity must necessarily connect with the [National Ultra-Broadband Plan] (http://bandaultralarga.italia.it/).

The availability of connectivity in Public Administrations is very diverse. Typically, Public Administrations - especially the local ones - have an underdeveloped situation that does not meet the criteria defined by the Public Connectivity System (SPC). By 2017, the PAs must adapt their connection capacity, giving preference - in the choice of connectivity services - to supplies in which the transport service is based on the IPv6 protocol.

Amongst the actions envisaged for the adaptation of Public Administration connectivity are: the drafting and adaptation of the guidelines for the construction of public Wi-Fi networks.
