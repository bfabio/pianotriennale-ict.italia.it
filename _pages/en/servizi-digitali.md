The Plan promotes the development of public digital services by means of different strategies, such as:  - dissemination of enabling platforms,
- production of dedicated guidelines and development kits, 
- creation of a community of developers, designers and digital service managers that can collaborate and participate in the growth of the public administration.

AgID has issued Design Guidelines for the services and sites of the Public Administration, with the aim of defining common rules for the design of interfaces, services and content, improving and making consistent the navigation and the experience of citizens, and contributing to a reduction in the PA&#39;s expenditure for the design and creation of a new product (whether an application, a website or a digital service). The site [design.italia.it](http://design.italia.it), active since November 2015, collates instructions for the design and implementation of the PA services.

These are the main objectives:

- to promote and spread the open source paradigm;
- to encourage the adoption of enabling platforms (such as [SPID](http://www.spid.gov.it), [PagoPA](http://www.agid.gov.it/agenda-digitale/pubblica-amministrazione/pagamenti-elettronici), [ANPR](http://www.agid.gov.it/agenda-digitale/pubblica-amministrazione/anagrafe-nazionale-anpr)) through the creation and dissemination of development kits, validation and verification environments, transparent communication regarding the progress of each project and the reporting and discussion of anomalies;
- to provide useful guidelines and toolkits for the development of applications and services with adequate levels of design, user experience, security and usability;
- to promote the development of digital products and services based on the use of databases, APIs and information made available by the PAs;
- to share information and software components that will reduce the implementation cost for new digital products, encouraging the reuse and interoperability;
- to support the administrations in the dissemination and popularisation of services and tools necessary for communicating the Three-Year Plan&#39;s implementation path.
