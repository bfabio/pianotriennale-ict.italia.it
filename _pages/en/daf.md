The Data &amp; Analytics Framework (DAF) is one of the main activities for the enhancement of national public information assets, with the aim of developing and simplifying the interoperability of public data between the PAs, standardizing and promoting the dissemination of open data, optimizing the processes of data analysis and knowledge generation. The idea is to open up the world of Public Administration to the benefits offered by modern platforms for the management and analysis of big data, acting along four main lines: 
- amplify the value of the information assets of the PA through the use of big data technologies that allow for the creation of knowledge and which drastically reduce analysis times; 
- encourage and optimise the exchange of data between the PAs, minimizing the transaction costs for access and use; 
- encourage the dissemination of open data and make its use more effective; 
- favour the exploratory analysis of data by data scientist teams, both within individual PAs and at a central level, to improve awareness of social phenomena.

The DAF will allow for the promotion of scientific research initiatives on issues of particular interest to the PAs, encouraging collaboration with universities and research bodies.
