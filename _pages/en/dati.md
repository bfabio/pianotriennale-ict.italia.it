Data from the Public Administrations, together with the mechanisms and platforms created to provide services to citizens, are one of the major digital assets of the PA. To best exploit the potential, it is necessary to overcome the &quot;silo logic&quot; in favour of a systemic vision.

The Plan has identified three areas of action for the enhancement of public information assets concerning the databases of national interest, open data and controlled vocabularies.

The databases constitute the backbone of public information assets, to be made available to all PAs, facilitating the exchange of data and avoiding the need to ask citizens or enterprises for the same information over and over again.

With regards to public data managed by public administrations, open data involves a process aimed at rendering it open and free for reuse and redistribution, with the sole exception of that subject to particular restrictions.

Controlled vocabularies and data models are useful in the facilitation of the data exchange process between PAs through codes and shared ontologies.
