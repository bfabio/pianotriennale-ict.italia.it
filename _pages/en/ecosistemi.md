Ecosystems are the sectors or areas where action is taken by the Public Administrations, such as for health, agriculture, education and cultural heritage. Each ecosystem identifies a thematic sector displaying a certain level of homogeneity. It includes public entities and organisations and may also include private entities.

Ecosystems are based on shared rules, common guidelines, communication protocols, enabling platforms and other tools that help facilitate interoperability and coordination.

AgID has provided an initial definition of the ecosystems on the basis of the classification regarding the Missions and Programmes indicated in the 2016 Budget Law.
