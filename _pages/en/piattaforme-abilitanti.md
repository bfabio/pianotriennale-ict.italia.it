Enabling platforms are solutions that offer key, transversal and reusable functionality in individual projects, by standardising their delivery methods.

The implementation of enabling platforms has already begun. Some examples for citizens and businesses are [SPID] (http://www.spid.gov.it), CIE, [PagoPA] (http://www.agid.gov.it/agenda-digitale/pubblica-amministrazione/pagamenti-elettronici), and Electronic invoicing. Other platforms are aimed mainly towards the PA, yet are still enabling platforms, such as the [National Resident Registry] (http://www.agid.gov.it/agenda-digitale/pubblica-amministrazione/anagrafe-nazionale-anpr) (ANPR).

Some platforms are already operational, but not yet being used by all administrations, whilst others are under construction or in the planning stage, as is the case for ComproPA, SIOPE+, [NoiPA] (https://noipa.mef.gov.it/), the Management System for national administrative procedures and the Conservation hubs.

It is necessary to complete the realisation of the platforms and to favour their adoption; to implement and improve those that already exist, adding new functionalities and adjusting their security level. Then, it is important to complete the platforms that have already been planned and to identify new ones that will accelerate the digitisation process of the Public Administration.
