The enabling platforms are solutions that offer key, transversal and reusable functionality in individual projects, by standardizing their delivery methods.

The enabling platforms process has already begun. Some examples for citizens and businesses are [SPID] (http://www.spid.gov.it), CIE, [PagoPA] (http://www.agid.gov.it/agenda-digitale/pubblica-amministrazione/pagamenti-elettronici), Electronic invoicing. Other platforms are aimed mainly towards the PA, yet are equally dedicated to all who are enabled access, such as the [National Resident Registry] (http://www.agid.gov.it/agenda-digitale/pubblica-amministrazione/anagrafe-nazionale-anpr) (ANPR).

Certain platforms are already operational, but not yet being utilised by all administrations, whilst others are under construction or in the planning stage, as is the case for ComproPA, SIOPE+, [NoiPA] (https://noipa.mef.gov.it/), management system for national administrative procedures and conservation hubs.

It is necessary to complete the realisation of the platforms and to favour their adoption, to implement and improve those that already exist with new functionalities, adjusting the security level, completing those that are already planned and identifying new ones that accelerate the digitisation process of the Public Administration.
