In this section, you can find a list of documents (ministerial circulars,
guidelines and other documents) that are related to the Three-Year Plan for the
digital transformation of the country, and are published on [Docs
Italia](https://docs.developers.italia.it/).â€¨

[Docs Italia](https://docs.developers.italia.it/) agrees with an open government
philosophy where documents can be easily read online, thus favouring the public
consultation process: anyone can contribute, making comments and suggestions
paragraph by paragraph.
