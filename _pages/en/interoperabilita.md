The definition of an interoperability model is a cornerstone of the entire Public Information System: it ensures the interaction and the exchange of information between the PAs without the need for specific integrations. In this way, it is possible to ensure full cooperation between Public Administrations and private subjects.

The consolidation and definition of a new interoperability model sees AgID involved in the definition of technical rules, guidelines, technological standards and profiles that each PA must adopt.

The objective is to create technological conditions that favour the development of innovative application solutions focused on citizens, businesses and the Administrations themselves.
