One of the main objectives of the Three-Year Plan is to guide the rationalisation of Public Administration spending on ICT and its reorientation at national level as defined, in the first instance, by the Stability Law of 2016.

The savings objective is intended as being a reduction in the expenditure achieved through the three-year period according to the principles for the containment of this enunciated by the law, which aims to encourage the redevelopment of expenditure and orient the path of optimisation and control. 

The savings objective regarding expenditure for the 2016-2018 three-year period has been defined in the measure of 50% of the total current expenditure of the administrations (photographed in the Plan) - which represents the expendable outlay for the purpose of the spending review.
