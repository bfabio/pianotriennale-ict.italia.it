The PA cloud is part of the national physical infrastructure, together with the communication networks, the data centres, the disaster recovery and business continuity systems, and the equipment necessary for monitoring and security.

The PA cloud presents a fragmented and irregular situation, as is also the case for data centres. A rationalisation of physical infrastructures is necessary not only from a structural point of view but also from an economic perspective. The creation and definition of a strategic evolutionary model of the PA cloud will render it possible to virtualise the machinery park of all public administrations, with important benefits in terms of costs and maintenance management.

The plan to rationalise the PA&#39;s ICT resources requires that AgID: 

- identify a physical infrastructures unit of the PA that will become the Poli Strategici Nazionali (PSN -  Strategic National Hub); 
- define the direction the PA should follow towards the cloud also through the resources made available by the PSN and SPC; 
- define a qualification process for the NSPs and other Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).
