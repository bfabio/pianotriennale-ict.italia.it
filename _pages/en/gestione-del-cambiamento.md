To achieve the objectives defined by the Three-Year Plan, it is essential to coordinate a variety of different subjects in the role, in the function and organisation, with all called upon to participate in the implementation of the national strategy.

The Agency for Digital Italy, which has the task of leading the activities related to the strategic evolution of the Public Administration&#39;s IT system, defines a governance model that guarantees: 
- support in the implementation of the Plan, with initiatives aimed at facilitating , sensitizing and training the Public Administrations involved in the digital transformation process.
- monitoring the implementation activities with respect to two macro areas: 
- the technical aspects, aimed at verifying the implementation of the planned actions, through a set of indicators of achievement and results, the latter to be linked to the DESI indicators where possible; 
- the economic aspects, connected to the systematic collection of data on ICT expenditure by the administrations, to verify the progress in the rationalisation and redirection towards those destined for investments.

To achieve the objectives outlined, AgID: 
- assists the selected PAs in carrying out the role of aggregator in the implementation of organisational and instrumental activities.
- promotes the fulfilment by the administrations of the obligation to identify the office responsible for the transition to digital as referred to in Article 17 of the CAD.
