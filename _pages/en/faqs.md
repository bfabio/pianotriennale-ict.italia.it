  - title: 1 - What is the objective of the Tree-year Plan?
    text: |
      The Three-Year Plan is a document with a strategic and economic focus, through which the Strategic Model of the evolution of the Public Administration information system (hereafter, "Strategic Model") is declined.

      Laid out in the AgID bylaws and by the 2016 Stability Law (28th December 2015, no. 208), the Plan was created to effectively guide the digital transformation of the Public Administration and becomes a reference for central and local administrations in the development of their own information systems. It defines the guidelines of the operational strategy for the development of public information technology, establishes the fundamental architectural principles, the rules of usability and interoperability, specifies the logic for classifying ICT expenses and clarifies the model for digital development.

      The main objectives of the Three-Year Plan are:

      - define the guidelines for the development and implementation of the Public Administration information system in an organic framework based on the objectives of the Italian Digital Agenda, and therefore of the Digital Growth Plan;
      - rationalizing, therefore, requalifying the ICT expenditure of the administrations in line with the objectives of the 2016 Stability Law.
  - title: 2 - What is the difference between the Digital Growth Strategy and the Three-Year Plan?
    text: |
      The [Digital Growth Strategy] (http://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/documenti_indirizzo/strategia_crescita_digitale_ver_def_21062016.pdf) - whose approval by the European Commission has allowed for the approval of the structural funds for Italy - is the Italian Digital Agenda, being the strategic document that describes how the relationship between the PA and the citizen must change through the identification of strategic projects; the Three-Year Plan is its operational and technical development.

      Setting out from the indications of the Digital Growth Strategy, AgID and the Digital Transformation Team have worked on setting up individual projects to reach the elaboration of an inclusive and competitive strategy that allows the country to go from a start-up phase to one of industrial progression of digital development.
  - title: 3 - What the Three-Year Plan is not.
    text: |
      The Three-Year Plan ** is not ** a complete, specific, eternal set of instructions.
      The administrations will not find detailed investment planning for each individual and specific case of digital transformation of their services, nor all the answers to their questions.  This is why we have planned a dynamic process of the Plan's evolution  and a process of support that helps interpret the Plan and incorporates the new information into the next phase.
  - title: 4 - Which professional figures within the administrations must read the Plan?
    text: |
      The reading of the Three-Year Plan is aimed at both the decision-making level of the administrations - to adapt the planning of the activities to the national strategy - and the operational level, for the detailed planning of the solutions to be implemented.
  - title: 5 - What are the most important innovations and changes contained in the Plan?
    text: |
      The innovation is the Plan itself, intended as the first document containing actions, times and objectives of the strategy's implementation pathway, providing clear indications to each Public Administration.

      In addition, in order to broaden the possibilities for discussion and participation, collaboration tools are used for developers and aimed at disseminating technology projects: [Github](https://github.com/italia/pianotriennale-ict-doc), [ReadTheDocs] (https://pianotriennale-ict.readthedocs.io/) and [Discourse](https://forum.italia.it) (see FAQ no. 15).
  - title: 6 - What is the duration of the Three-year plan?
    text: |
      The Plan has an annual duration. The 2017 version defines the activities of 2018. By the end of September each year, an updated version will be issued that will direct the actions for the following year.
  - title: 7 - Has the 2017 Triennial Plan been shared with the recipient administrations?
    text: |
      The 2017 version has seen the collaboration of:

      - Sogei
      - CONSIP
      - the commissioner of the Spending Review
      - the central PAs, in particular being the Ministries including all supervised entities
      - the tax agencies
      - the social security institutions
      - the regions
      - the metropolitan cities of Italy
      - the provinces
      - the instrumental entities
      - ANCI

      Already from the drafting of the 2018 version - also thanks to the input deriving from the use of the technical sharing tools (see FAQ no. 15) - the collaboration and involvement of the administrations and the communities of reference will be extended.
  - title: 8 - What information does the Three-Year Plan provide to the Public Administrations to achieve the cost savings required by the Stability Law?
    text: |
      The Three-Year Plan provides useful indications to the Public Administrations for the planning of technology investments for the next three years, so as to allow for each individual administration to redevelop expenditure and achieve savings in terms of the current expenditure established by the Stability Law for investments in innovation technology.
      The Stability Law no. 208 of 28th December 2015, paragraphs 512 and 514-bis, imposes upon Public Administrations an objective to save on annual expenditure, to be achieved at the end of the 2016-2018 three-year period, equal to 50 per cent of the average annual expenditure for the current management of the IT sector net only of the fees for connectivity and expenditure services carried out through Consip SpA or aggregating subjects and requires the Three-Year Plan to identify the expenditure components through which such savings can be achieved and those destined to be excluded. The savings deriving from the implementation of these provisions can be used, in accordance with the provisions of the law, by the administrations as a priority for investments in technological innovation.
  - title: 9 - On what kind of information is the Three-Year Plan based?
    text: |
      For the first time, Three-Year Plan provides a picture of the current situation regarding the type of administration and expenditure. The determinations made are based on the detailed analysis of a significant sample of PAs and on directions of the sector relative to all the other administrations.
  - title: 10 - How do you ensure that the administrations follow the Plan and what happens if an administration does not follow the Plan?
    text: |
      The Law no. 208 of 28th December 2015 highlights the Three-Year Plan for the Public Administrations as an official document to be followed in order to plan its own investments in ICT over the next three years.
      As indicated in the Plan and set out under Article 17 of the Digital Administration Code, each administration must appoint an internal Digital Processing Manager who can be in constant communication with AgID and the Digital Transformation Team in order to implement the actions envisaged by the Plan itself.
      In the correction of the Digital Administration Code, given the difficulty for each administration to find adequate professional skills concerning specific technological skills, it is planned to have the administrations can share qualified human resources for this type of role.
      AgID and the Digital Transformation Team have also decided to share the Plan through modern collaboration tools, including [Github](https://github.com/italia/pianotriennale-ict-doc), [Docs](https://pianotriennale-ict.readthedocs.io/it/latest/) - the new public document management system created with ReadTheDocs - and [Forum](https://forum.italia.it/c/piano-triennale)
      - the discussion forum on public services, in order to provide structured support to the administrations.
      AgID will activate a continuous monitoring process to receive feedback from the administrations on the implementation of the actions envisaged in the Plan and to provide any additional support in case of criticality.
      The directions contained in the Plan have the objective to focusing Public Administration expenditure in the Digital Transformation and are therefore binding for the Administrations in planning their investments.
      In fact, digital is considered a fundamental resource for the country, leading to requalifying spending and innovation.
      Any administration that delays adapting to the actions described in the Three-Year Plan should be considered as an unnecessary cost to the State, which must be hindered through the necessary tools to control public spending.
  - title: 11 - If an Administration does not have the skills or resources to implement the Plan, what can be done?
    text: |
      Shown within the Three-Year Plan are the competencies that must be identified and the purchasing tools necessary to plan investments aimed towards implementing the technological choices contained in the Plan itself.
      What's more, as indicated in the Plan and set out under Article 17 of the Digital Administration Code, each administration must appoint an internal Digital Processing Manager who can be in constant communication with AgID and the Digital Transformation Team in order to implement the actions envisaged by the Plan itself.
      In the correction of the Digital Administration Code, given the difficulty for each administration to find adequate professional skills concerning specific technological skills, it is planned to have the administrations can share qualified human resources for this type of role.
      AgID and the Digital Transformation Team have also decided to share the Plan through modern collaboration tools, including [Github] (https://github.com/italia/pianotriennale-ict-doc), [Docs] (https://pianotriennale-ict.readthedocs.io/it/latest/) - the new public document management system created with ReadTheDocs - and [Forum] (https://forum.italia.it/c/piano-triennale) - the forum for discussions on public services, in order to provide a structured support to administrations in the definition of investments, including research or the sharing of technological skills and support for the procurement of financial resources, including those relating to the Regional Operational Plans.
  - title: 12 - Can an administration receive clarifications? How will the PA support phase be managed?
    text: |
      AgID will assist the PA in the implementation of the Three-Year Plan also through collaboration with certain aggregator subjects that will be identified after an initial series of meetings that will be concluded by September 2017.

      In order to also involve developers and experts in the sector, sharing and collaboration tools will also be introduced with the aim of diffusing technology projects: [Github](https://github.com/italia/pianotriennale-ict-doc), [ReadTheDocs](https://pianotriennale-ict.readthedocs.io/) and [Discourse](https://forum.italia.it). (see FAQ No. 15).
  - title: 13 - How will the administrations be involved in drafting the next version of the Three-Year Plan?
    text: |
      Involvement will be through the work structured together with the entities (aggregators and non) that will collaborate with AgID and the Digital Team in the implementation of the Plan. Naturally, the involvement will also take place thanks to the suggestions that will emerge through the use of [Github](https://github.com/italia/pianotriennale-ict-doc), [ReadTheDocs] (https://pianotriennale-ict.readthedocs.io/) and [Discourse](https://forum.italia.it) (see FAQ n.15).
  - title: 14 - The Plan envisages the future creation of multiple guidelines that are not yet ready. What are they and how will the creation and publication process be managed?
    text: |
      In order to efficiently implement the directions described in the Plan, AgID has decided to collate the technological specifications related to multiple options of focus within the guidelines.
      Amongst the guidelines that will be released in the coming months are:

      * Guidelines for the rationalisation of the ICT assets of the Public Administrations (First release date: January 2018);
      * Guidelines for developing and maintaining applications for cloud of the PA (release date: December 2017);
      Guidelines for migrating legacy applications to the PA's cloud environment (release date: June 2018);
      * Guidelines for the implementation of public Wi-Fi networks (release date: December 2017);
      * Guidelines for integration with the DAF (release date: TBD);
      * Open data guidelines (release date: July 2017);
      * Interoperability guidelines and rules (release date: June 2018);
      * Guidelines for transitioning to the new Interoperability Model (release date: May 2017);
      * Guidelines for the new Interoperability Model (release date: December 2017);
      * Guidelines for the architectural model of the critical service management (release date: June 2017)
      * Guidelines for the ICT security of Public Administrations (release date: June 2017).

      The progressive drafting of the guidelines will be accompanied by communication through the newsletter dedicated to the Three-Year Plan. The guidelines will be made available in draft form to collect comments and suggestions that will be evaluated, discussed, and possibly integrated using the Github tools and the forum.
      Only once consensus is reached and a final version is created will the official publication take place, both on the website and in the official gazette.
  - title: 15 - Why Github, Docs and Forum for communication about the Plan?
    text: |
      We want to be able to share the Plan also within the community of developers and experts in the sector, including those within the Public Administration. To achieve this goal, we want to use the tools for sharing and collaboration that are used by these communities to spread their technology projects: Github, ReadTheDocs (for the creation of a public document management system) and Discourse (for the creation of a discussion on public services).
       [Github](https://github.com/italia/pianotriennale-ict-doc) is a technological platform used to share text files and source code, and implements two very important and features that are useful in sharing the Three-Year Plan by providing a dedicated support service:
       * issue: the function of opening an issue, accessible within the issue tab in each section of Github, dedicated to a part of the chapter of the Three-Year Plan through the green button at the top right - "New Issue" - that allows for the isolation of a specific element of a discussion to start a discourse and in-depth evaluation;
       * pull request: accessible through the pen icon in the Github header within each chapter or section of the Plan, this function allows users to make suggestions and recommend changes to parts of the text of the Plan itself.

      Both functions are managed by maintainers belonging to AgID and the Digital Transformation Team, who evaluate the requests received and provide answers that support the administrations with regards to any problems, critical issues or points to be clarified.
       [ReadTheDocs](https://pianotriennale-ict.readthedocs.io/) is a platform for sharing text documents in html, organised according to a classic division into chapters and sections and a lateral index to scroll through the chapters themselves, which permits use of the document on every device in a fluid way and with an easy search function.
      [Discourse](https://forum.italia.it/c/piano-triennale) is a technological platform that allows for the creation of a forum for the discussion and sharing of specific themes with the community and the request for support on particular aspects of the Three-Year Plan.
      Such technology collaboration platforms are used by developers to share technical documents and development code and to collect contributions, comments and suggestions in a simple and effective way.
      It is an easy and natural way to create a sharing environment in which one can speak a technological language.

  - title: 16 - Why does the Three-Year Plan come out in May 2017?
    text: |
      Drafting concluded at the end of March 2017, upon the consolidation process of the document being completed, which saw the collaboration of the administrations involved. Subsequently launched was the procedure for official approval by the Council of Ministers and the creation of the necessary tools for sharing and dissemination for the support to be provided to the Public Administrations.
  - title: 17 - What comes after this version of the Plan?
    text: |
      The Three-Year Plan is a document in constant evolution, that will be adapted and updated over time, constituting a permanent guide for the Administrations.
      New versions of the Plan will thus be published by September of each year, following approval of AgID's proposal by the President of the Council of Ministers or by the Minister for Innovation, so as to gather and integrate the suggestions and recommendations that will come from the Github tools and the forum.
      Several guidelines will therefore emerge from the plan, which, as will be subsequently explained, will then be submitted to the community before being published.
      AgID and the Digital Processing Team will also work to collect, construct and provide tools such as software, libraries, recommendations and documental procedures to facilitate Public Administrations in the implementation of the Plan, using the portal [Developers Italia](https://developers.italia.it).
